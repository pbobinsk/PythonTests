2. Materials and methods
The experimental work was carried out on a small garage roof structure (no. I - Fig. 1) with a span of 400 cm and a height of 70 cm, and on two larger roof structures of single-family houses with widths of 810 cm (no. II - Fig. 2) and 850 cm, each having a height of 500 cm. Measurements on the roof trusses II (Fig. 2) and III were conducted in the upper sections of the structures above the attic. The rafters of structure no. I had a cross-section of 7 x 14 cm, while the rafters of structures II and III had a cross-section of 10 x 18 cm. All roofs were covered with metal roofing tiles.
The registration of the sounds of wood-boring larvae feeding was conducted using the AE method with the experimental system described in detail in earlier publications [Krajewski et al. 2012, Bilski et al. 2017, Nowakowska et al. 2017, Krajewski et al. 2020, Krajewski et al. 2022, Krajewski et al. 2024]. Acoustic emission signals were recorded using equipment composed of a piezoelectric sensor (CCLD model 4507-B-005, Bruel & Kjaer), an external sound card (E-MU Tracker Pre, Creative), and a laptop (Lenovo Ideapad) with Windows 7 operating system and Adobe Audition software. The sensor was connected via a converter to the sound card directly attached to the computer via USB 2.0. The sampling frequency used was 44.1 kHz with a resolution of 16 bits. Signals were recorded by the sound card and displayed as graphical recordings on the computer monitor. The signals were recorded as amplitude level relative to the maximum possible amplitude that can be recorded by the sound card, i.e., the amplitude that can be achieved through the analog-to-digital converter regulation.
The recording was conducted using a two-channel method to allow for the removal of random background sounds not originating from longhorn beetle larvae. TU DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE FOR REMOVING BACKGROUND NOISE
The average density of the wood of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) used in the experimental elements ranged from 485 to 510 to 545 kg/m3. The wooden elements used in the experiments contained ½ to ¾ of sapwood. The experiments consisted of two stages. It was assumed that the wooden elements used in the experiments appropriately attached to the construction would transmit electroacoustic signals not only from their interior but also from the roof truss and roof covering. Each time, a pair of wooden elements was used (control element C without larvae and one of the elements A, B, D, and E with larvae). Larvae were placed in individual blocks with the following weights: A – 0.064 g and 0.015 g, B – 0.053 g and 0.016 g, D – 0.044 g and 0.024 g, and E – 0.027 g and 0.025 g. It was assumed that the acoustic effect of larvae feeding in elements A, B, D, and E would not transmit to element C, which only collected any random background noises. Piezoelectric sensors were affixed to the radial cross-section of the wooden elements using GE Bayer Silicone grease.
In July/August 2021, trials of two-channel recording of longhorn beetle larvae (Hylotrupes bajulus L.) activity were conducted under controlled conditions on the roof structures. Controlled conditions were understood as knowledge of the presence of larvae in the wood (number of larvae and their mass). For this purpose, pairs of wooden elements with larvae and the same element without larvae were installed in the roof structures such that the AE apparatus could capture all acoustic signals from the roof structure and roofing. All signals included noises from larvae feeding as well as creaking of the wooden structure and noises from impacts on the roofing (bird hopping, falling twigs, cones, etc.). The longhorn beetle larvae originated from a breeding program conducted in the laboratory of Warsaw University of Life Sciences – SGGW.
In the first stage, the effectiveness of the system was tested on one small roof structure (roof no. I) and 4 elements with larvae. Two-channel acoustic signals were recorded from wooden blocks measuring 5 x 10 x 20 cm (Fig. 1). They were attached using single bar clamps to 2 adjacent segments of the roof structure covered with metal roofing tiles. One block (C as a control) did not contain live larvae, while 2 larvae were placed in each of the remaining blocks (A, B, D, and E) in drilled holes in the sapwood with diameters corresponding to the diameter of their bodies. The distance between the holes with larvae was 3-4 cm. The holes were sealed with a transparent plastic plate, fixed in place with pins, to ensure that the larvae did not turn around or fall out of the wood. Measurements were conducted 2 weeks after the introduction of the larvae to the wood when it was confirmed that the larvae had burrowed into the wood. For the electroacoustic measurements, a pair of blocks was used each time (element C without larvae and one of the four elements A, B, D, or E with larvae). Sensors were placed on the surface of blocks measuring 5 x 20 cm beneath the location of the larvae (Fig. 1).

After confirming the effectiveness of the methodology in the first stage, the second stage commenced. In the second stage, experiments on the registration of acoustic signals were carried out on 3 roof structures. The recording on each roof was conducted on 4 wooden elements (A, B, D, and E) with larvae and control element C without larvae. The same sets of measurement elements were placed in pairs in succession on the following roofs. The dimensions of the elements were 5 x 10 x 220 cm. Two larvae were placed in drilled holes in the sapwood on a surface of 5 x 10 cm in each of the 4 elements. In the individual elements, the same larvae were used as in the blocks in the first stage of the experiment. The distance between the holes with larvae was 3-4 cm. The holes were closed with plates made of transparent plastic, and the larvae were allowed to burrow into the wood. A pair of elements (element C without larvae and one of the elements A, B, D, and E with larvae) was placed on the roof structure each time. The elements were attached to neighboring rafters. Each element was secured using one pair of bar clamps (Fig. 2). Measurements were conducted at points in the center of the 5 x 220 cm surface at intervals of 50 cm, starting from the point directly below the larva placement and at analogous points on control element C. The distance between neighboring rafters and the attached elements with larvae was 70-75 cm. It was assumed that the acoustic effect of larvae feeding in elements A, B, D, and E would not transmit to element C, which only collects any background sounds.
In all cases of the first and second stage, the sensors were coated with GE Bayer Silicones and pressed firmly to the wood with rubber wood bands. The registration of acoustic signals on all 3 roof structures was conducted at air temperatures in the attic ranging from 20 to 40°C, which conditioned the activity of the larvae (Creemers 2015, Krajewski et al. 2017, Krajewski et al. 2020).

NOTE: the lower section visible in Fig. 2 needs to be cropped as it shows single-channel recording, or it should be replaced with a picture of the laptop with two-channel recording (better option – to be done).
In the context of construction practice, a quick and uncomplicated visual assessment of the effects of recording the presence of larvae in the wood of the structure is crucial. The recording is evaluated on the laptop screen. For this reason, the detectability of larvae was visually assessed based on the recorded data for each measurement point in the four elements on each of the three roof structures. The following scale was adopted for the assessment: no recording -, 1-2 visible signals +, 3-5 signals ++, more than 5 signals +++.
