1. Introduction 

The Detection of Acoustic Emission (AE) method has garnered significant interest over several decades for the detection and study of wood-destroying insects. For more than four decades, research has focused on detecting the old house borer (Hylotrupes bajulus L.) using Detection of Acoustic Emission (AE) [Kerner et al. 1980, Pallaske 1988, Plinke 1991, Schofield 2011, Krajewski et al. 2012, Brandstetter et al. 2015, Creemers 2015, Bilski et al. 2017, Nowakowska et al. 2017, Krajewski et al. 2020, Krajewski et al. 2024, Krajewski et al. 2024]. This beetle species is widely distributed globally [Becker 1949, Becker 1949, Becker 1970] and poses the greatest threat to wooden construction structures in Central and Northern Europe [Wichmand 1941, Becker 1949, Becker 1949, Krajewski 1995], despite a recent decrease in the number of infested buildings in certain regions of Europe [Dominik 2005]. 

Laboratory studies have been conducted on the influence of temperature on the ability to detect the presence of old house borer larvae in wood using the AE method [Palaske 1986, Creemers 2015, Nowakowska et al. 2017, Krajewski et al. 2020]. Research has also focused on the impact of the size of old house borer larvae [Krajewski et al. 2022, Krajewski et al. 2024] and their distance from the measurement apparatus sensor [Krajewski et al. 2022] on the effectiveness of the AE method. Efforts were successfully made to develop appropriate tools for assessing the effectiveness of the AE method in detecting old house borer larvae, specifically through counting periods of larval activity, the number of bites, and especially the calculated energy generated during wood boring [Bilski et al.2017, Krajewski et al. 2020].

Research has also long focused on detecting other insects developing in wooden construction structures using the AE method, including Anobiidae [Esser and Vanstaalduinen 1999, Creemers 2015] and termites [Fujii et al. 1989, Mankin et al. 1996, Lemaster et al. 1997, Fujii et al. 1999, Mankin et al. 2002, Nocero 2003, Dunegan 2005, Mankin and Moore 2010]. Investigations have been conducted on detecting other expansive Cerambycidae (Coleoptera) species developing in tree trunks using the AE method: the Asian longhorned beetle (Anaplophora glabripennis Motschulsky) [Becker 2000, Schofield 2011] and Neoplocaederus ferrugineus (L.) [Maruthadurai et al. 2022], and the significant palm pest Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) [Mankin et al. 2016].

In the case of the old house borer, assessing the feasibility of effectively applying the AE method in practical construction conditions is particularly important, i.e., on large structures in changing thermal conditions during summer. What is the minimum distance the sensor must be placed from the larval habitation site in the wooden structure? Even more crucial is the elimination of background noise (creaking of structures due to wind, car noises, birds hopping on the roof, or falling objects such as branches or pine cones from trees, etc.), which can be recorded alongside the sounds of larval feeding. To eliminate these random background noises, attempts were made to use dual-channel AE registration.
