1. Introduction  
      The method of Detection of Acoustic Emission (AE) has been of interest for several decades in detecting and studying the life of wood-destroying insects. For over four decades, research has been conducted on detecting old house borer (Hylotrupes bajulus L.) using Detection of Acoustic Emission (AE) [Kerner et al. 1980, Pallaske 1988, Plinke 1991, Schofield 2011, Krajewski et al. 2012, Brandstetter et al. 2015, Creemers 2015, Bilski et al. 2017, Nowakowska et al. 2017, Krajewski et al. 2020, Krajewski et al. 2024, Krajewski et al. 2024]. This beetle species is very widespread globally [Becker 1949, Becker 1949, Becker 1970], and in Central and Northern Europe, it poses the greatest threat to wooden structural elements [Wichmand 1941, Becker 1949, Becker 1949, Krajewski 1995], despite an observed decrease in the number of infested buildings in certain regions of Europe in recent times [Dominik 2005].  
      Laboratory studies have been conducted to investigate the influence of temperature on the ability to register the presence of old house borer larvae in wood using the AE method [Palaske 1986, Creemers 2015, Nowakowska et al. 2017, Krajewski et al. 2020]. Laboratory studies have also explored the impact of the size of old house borer larvae [Krajewski et al. 2022, Krajewski et al. 2024] and their distance from the measurement sensor [Krajewski et al. 2022] on the effectiveness of the AE method. Attempts have also been successfully made to develop appropriate tools to assess the effectiveness of the AE method in detecting old house borer larvae, such as by counting the periods of larval activity, the number of bites, and especially the calculated energy resulting from woodboring [Bilski et al. 2017, Krajewski et al. 2020].  
      For many years, research has also been conducted on recording other insects that develop in the wood of structural buildings using the AE method, including Anobiidae [Esser and Vanstaalduinen 1999, Creemers 2015] and termites [Fujii et al. 1989, Mankin et al. 1996, Lemaster et al. 1997, Fujii et al. 1999, Mankin et al. 2002, Nocero 2003, Dunegan 2005, Mankin and Moore 2010]. Studies have also been undertaken to detect other expanding Cerambycidae (Coleoptera) species developing in tree trunks using the AE method: Asian longhorned beetle (Anaplophora glabripennis Motschulsky) [Becker 2000, Schofield 2011] and Neoplocaederus ferrugineus (L.) [Maruthadurai et al. 2022], as well as the dangerous palm pest Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) [Mankin et al. 2016].  
      In the case of the old house borer, assessing the effectiveness of the AE method in practical construction conditions is particularly important, that is, on large structures under changing thermal conditions during summer. What is the minimum distance from the larval habitat in the wood structure that the sensor must be placed? An even more significant issue is eliminating background noise (creaking of structures due to wind, sounds from vehicles, birds hopping on the roof covering, or falling objects, e.g., branches or cones from trees, etc.) that may be recorded alongside the sounds of larval feeding. To eliminate these incidental background sounds, trials of using the AE method under dual-channel recording conditions were conducted.
