DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECTS OF BACKGROUND REMOVAL, BELOW DISCUSSION OF TABLE 1. TO BE COMPLETED  
      The visual assessment on the laptop screen of the presence of insects is influenced by the activity of larvae and the distance of the sensor from the larvae's feeding site. As the distance of the sensor placement on the wood surface from the larvae's feeding site increased, the height of the registration recording (how to call it otherwise?) decreased due to the reduction in the size of the notional energy, as previously established in laboratory conditions [Krajewski et al. 2022].  
      With normal daily variations, temperature is the main influencing factor regarding insect activity [Pallaske 1986, Creemers 2015, Nowakowska et al. 2017, Krajewski et al. 2020], though for individual Hylotrupes larvae, significant phases of inactivity were found. Temperature itself is more of an influencing factor regarding insect activity than the specific time of day (as urged by internal circadian rhythms). The higher the temperature, the more AE events. There seems to be no apparent daily rhythm other than the influence of temperature [Creemers 2015]. Pallaske [1986] in laboratory tests kept his larvae under alternating conditions of 12 hours at 18 °C and 12 hours at 25 °C, and under these conditions measured clearly more activity during the warmer phases.  
      However, in our studies conducted in attic conditions during summer, the air temperature in Warsaw showed much greater fluctuations and significantly higher extreme values at the end of the day, reaching in some cases even up to 40°C in the attics of the buildings used in the research. Consequently, after a three-week period of such temperatures, the temperature inside the wood must have risen above 30°C. According to our previous laboratory experiences [Krajewski et al. 2020], a temperature of 36°C causes minimal activity expressed as the number of bites, while a temperature of 40°C completely excludes larvae activity. Additionally, a temperature of 34°C leads to a drastic decrease in the notional energy of bites [Krajewski et al. 2020]. These conditions may have caused the periodic dormancy of the larvae, for example in structure II, elements A and E, at a distance of 100 cm, or in structure I (element B) and structure III (element A) at a distance of 200 cm.
