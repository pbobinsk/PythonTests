2. Materials and Methods
Experimental work was conducted on a small garage roof structure (no. I - Fig. 1) with a span of 400 cm and a height of 70 cm, and two larger single-family house roof structures, each with a width of 810 cm (no. II - Fig. 2) and 850 cm, and a height of 500 cm. Measurements on roof trusses II (Fig. 2) and III were carried out on the upper parts of the construction above the attic. Rafters of structure I had a cross-section of 7 x 14 cm, while rafters of structures II and III had a cross-section of 10 x 18 cm. All roofs were covered with metal roofing tiles.
The registration of feeding sounds of larvae in wood using the AE method was conducted with an experimental system, described in detail in previous publications [Krajewski et al. 2012, Bilski et al. 2017, Nowakowska et al. 2017, Krajewski et al. 2020, Krajewski et al. 2022, Krajewski et al. 2024]. Acoustic emission signals were recorded using equipment consisting of a piezoelectric sensor (CCLD model 4507-B-005, Bruel & Kjaer), an external sound card (E-MU Tracker Pre, Creative), and a laptop (Lenovo Ideapad) running the Windows 7 operating system and Adobe Audition software. The sensor interfaced with the sound card via a converter, connected directly to the computer via USB 2.0. The applied sampling frequency was 44.1 kHz with a resolution of 16 bits. Signals were recorded by the sound card and presented graphically on the computer monitor. Signals were recorded as the amplitude level relative to the maximum possible amplitude recordable by the sound card, i.e., the maximum possible amplitude achievable by the analog-to-digital converter.
Recording was conducted using a dual-channel method to allow the elimination of random background noises not originating from longhorn beetle larvae. 

THIS SECTION DESCRIBES THE PROCEDURE FOR REMOVING BACKGROUND NOISES.

The average density of wood of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) used for experimental elements ranged from 485 to 510 to 545 kg/m3. The wooden elements used in the experiments contained ½ to ¾ of the sapwood. The experiments consisted of two stages. It was assumed that the wooden elements used in the experiments, suitably attached to the construction, would capture electroacoustic signals not only from within but also from the roof truss and roof covering. Each time, a pair of wooden elements was used (a control element C without larvae and one of elements A, B, D, and E with larvae). Larvae were placed in the respective blocks with the following masses: A – 0.064 g and 0.015 g, B – 0.053 g and 0.016 g, D – 0.044 g and 0.024 g, and E – 0.027 g and 0.025 g. It was assumed that the acoustic effect of larval feeding in elements A, B, D, and E would not transfer to element C, which only gathers any random background noises. Piezoelectric sensors were attached to the radial section of wooden elements using GE Bayer Silicone grease.
In July/August 2021, trials of dual-channel recording of longhorn beetle larvae (Hylotrupes bajulus L.) activity under controlled conditions on roof structures were conducted. Controlled conditions were understood as knowledge of the presence of longhorn beetle larvae in the wood (number of larvae and their mass). For this purpose, wooden elements with larvae and identical elements without larvae were installed in pairs within roof structures to ensure the AE apparatus received all acoustic signals from the roof structure and covering. All signals were understood as the sounds of the larvae feeding and the creaking of the wooden structure and the sounds of impacts on the roof covering (birds hopping, falling branches, and cones, etc.). Longhorn beetle larvae were sourced from a laboratory at Warsaw University of Life Sciences – SGGW.
In the first stage, the effectiveness of the system was tested on a single small roof structure (roof no. I) and 4 elements with larvae. Acoustic signals were recorded in a dual-channel manner from wooden blocks measuring 5 x 10 x 20 cm (Fig. 1). They were attached using single bar clamps to two adjacent segments of the roof structure covered with metal roofing tiles. One block (C as a control) did not contain live larvae, and each remaining block (A, B, D, and E) contained two longhorn beetle larvae placed in drilled holes in the sapwood with a diameter corresponding to their body diameter. The distance between larvae holes was 3-4 cm. Holes were sealed with a clear plastic plate affixed with pushpins to prevent larvae from turning and falling out of the wood. Measurements were conducted two weeks after introducing the larvae to the wood, ensuring the larvae had burrowed into the wood. For each electroacoustic measurement, a pair of blocks (element C without larvae and one of the four elements A, B, D, E with larvae) was placed. Sensors were located on the 5 x 20 cm surface of the blocks, directly beneath where the larvae were placed (Fig. 1).

After confirming the effectiveness of the methodology in the first stage, the second stage commenced. In the second stage, experiments on recording acoustic signals on 3 roof structures were conducted. Recordings on each roof involved 4 wooden elements (A, B, D, and E) with larvae and a control element C without larvae. Sequentially, the same measurement element pairs were placed on successive roofs. The elements measured 5 x 10 x 220 cm. Two larvae were placed in drilled holes in the sapwood on the 5 x 10 cm surface of each of the 4 elements. In individual elements, the same larvae were used as in the blocks of the first experiment stage. The distance between larvae holes was 3-4 cm. Holes were sealed with clear plastic sheets, waiting until the larvae burrow into the wood. Each time, a pair of elements (element C without larvae and one of elements A, B, D, E with larvae) were placed on the roof structure. Elements were attached to adjacent rafters. Each element was secured using one pair of bar clamps (Fig. 2). Measurements were taken at points on the middle 5 x 220 cm surface at 50 cm intervals starting from the point beneath the larvae placement and at equivalent points on the control element C. The distance between adjacent rafters and the attached elements with larvae was 70-75 cm. It was assumed that the acoustic effect of larval feeding in elements A, B, D, and E would not transfer to element C, which only collects any background noises.
In all cases of the first and second stage, sensors were coated with GE Bayer Silicones and firmly pressed to the wood with rubber bands. Acoustic signal registration on all 3 roof structures was conducted at attic air temperatures between 20 - 40°C, facilitating larvae activity [Creemers 2015, Krajewski et al. 2017, Krajewski et al. 2020].

NOTE: The lower section of the surface in Fig. 2 needs to be cut as it shows single-channel registration, or replace it with a picture of a laptop with dual-channel recording (better option – to be done).

In practical construction conditions, quick and uncomplicated visual assessment of registration effects of existing larvae in the wood of the structure comes into play. The record is assessed on a laptop screen. For this reason, the detectability of larvae was visually evaluated based on the recorded records for each measurement point in the four elements on each of the three roof structures. The following scale was adopted for assessment: no record -, 1-2 visible signals +, 3-5 signals ++, more than 5 signals +++.
