1. Introduction  
      The Acoustic Emission (AE) detection method has been of interest for several decades in detecting and studying the lives of wood-destroying insects. Research on detecting the old house borer (Hylotrupes bajulus L.) using the Acoustic Emission (AE) method has been conducted for over four decades [Kerner et al. 1980, Pallaske 1988, Plinke 1991, Schofield 2011, Krajewski et al. 2012, Brandstetter et al. 2015, Creemers 2015, Bilski et al. 2017, Nowakowska et al. 2017, Krajewski et al. 2020, Krajewski et al. 2024, Krajewski et al. 2024]. This beetle species is widely spread across the globe [Becker 1949, Becker 1949, Becker 1970] and poses the most significant threat to wooden construction structures in Central and Northern Europe [Wichmand 1941, Becker 1949, Becker 1949, Krajewski 1995], despite the observed decline in the number of buildings infested in some regions of Europe recently [Dominik 2005].  
      Laboratory studies have been conducted to evaluate the impact of temperature on the ability to register the presence of old house borer larvae in wood using the AE method [Palaske 1986, Creemers 2015, Nowakowska et al. 2017, Krajewski et al. 2020]. Laboratory experiments have also investigated the effect of the size of old house borer larvae [Krajewski et al. 2022, Krajewski et al. 2024] and their distance from the sensor of the measuring apparatus [Krajewski et al. 2022] on the effectiveness of the AE method. Attempts have been successfully made to develop an appropriate tool to assess the effectiveness of the AE method in detecting old house borer larvae, through counting the periods of larval activity, the number of bites, and especially the calculated energy generated from wood boring [Bilski et al. 2017, Krajewski et al. 2020].  
      For many years, research has also been conducted on recording other insects developing in wooden construction using the AE method, including Anobiidae [Esser and Vanstaalduinen 1999, Creemers 2015] and termites [Fujii et al. 1989, Mankin et al. 1996, Lemaster et al. 1997, Fujii et al. 1999, Mankin et al. 2002, Nocero 2003, Dunegan 2005, Mankin and Moore 2010]. Research has also been undertaken to detect other invasive Cerambycidae (Coleoptera) species developing in tree trunks using the AE method: Asian longhorned beetle (Anaplophora glabripennis Motschulsky) [Becker 2000, Schofield 2011] and Neoplocaederus ferrugineus (L.) [Maruthadurai et al. 2022], as well as the dangerous palm pest Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) [Mankin et al. 2016].  
      In the case of the old house borer, it is particularly important to assess the potential for the effective application of the AE method in practical construction contexts, that is, on large structures under changing thermal conditions during summer. At what minimum distance from the larval habitat in the wood of the structure must the sensor be placed? An even more critical issue is the elimination of background noises (creaking of the structure due to wind, sounds of cars, birds hopping on the roof covering, or falling objects, e.g., branches or cones from trees, etc.) that may be recorded along with the sounds of larval feeding. To eliminate these incidental background noises, tests have been conducted using the AE method in a dual-channel recording setup.
