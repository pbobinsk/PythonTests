DISCUSSION OF BACKGROUND REMOVAL EFFECTS, FOLLOWING DISCUSSION FOR TABLE 1. TO DO

The visual assessment of insect presence recordings on a laptop screen is influenced by larval activity and the distance of the sensor from the larval feeding site. As the distance between the sensor placement on the wood surface and the larval feeding site increased, the height of the registration record (how to name this differently?) decreased due to the reduction in the magnitude of nominal energy, as previously observed under laboratory conditions [Krajewski et al. 2022].

Under normal daily fluctuations, temperature is the primary factor influencing insect activity [Pallaske 1986, Creemers 2015, Nowakowska et al. 2017, Krajewski et al. 2020], although significant phases of inactivity have been noted for individual Hylotrupes larvae. Temperature itself is more of a factor affecting insect activity than a specific time of day (according to the internal circadian rhythm). The higher the temperature, the more AE events occur. There seems to be no distinct circadian rhythm other than the influence of temperature [Creemers 2015]. Pallaske [1986] kept his larvae in variable conditions: 12 hours at 18°C and 12 hours at 25°C, and under these conditions, significantly higher activity was measured during the warmer phases.

However, in our studies conducted in the attic conditions of buildings during summer, the air temperature in Warsaw exhibited much greater fluctuations and a significantly higher extreme value at the end of the day, reaching up to 40°C in some attics used in the studies. Consequently, after a three-week period of such temperatures, the internal wood temperature had to exceed 30°C. According to our previous laboratory experiences [Krajewski et al. 2020], a temperature of 36°C already causes minimal activity expressed as the number of bites, and a temperature of 40°C completely excludes larval activity. Moreover, a temperature of 34°C already causes a drastic decrease in the nominal energy of bites [Krajewski et al. 2020]. These conditions might have caused periodic silence of the larvae, for example, in the case of construction II, elements A and E, at a distance of 100 cm, or construction I (element B) and construction III (element A) at a distance of 200 cm.
